# Lyrics Scroller

A Tkinter app that scrolls lyrics from bottom to top, like movie credits. Yeah, it has some features. I made this because I was very pissed off. Let's get this over with. And yeah it looks like a crappy crap, nvm.

## Features

- Scrolls lyrics from bottom to top. Simple enough, right?
- Adjust the scrolling speed. Because apparently, some of you need things faster or slower.
- Pause and resume scrolling. Because interruptions are a thing.
- Increase and decrease font size. For those of you who can't read the default size.
- Multiple color themes. I mean three only. You're welcome.
- Mouse wheel scrolling. Because why not?

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/doomscroller-lyrics-scroller.git
    cd lyrics-scroller
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    Just install Python 3.x and Tkinter. Google it if you don't know how.

    For Debian-based Linux distributions, you can install Tkinter using:
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install python3-tk
    ```

3. **Run the application**:
    ```sh
    python lyrics_scroller.py
    ```

## Usage

1. **Input Lyrics**: Type or paste your lyrics into the text input area on the left. I don't care what you do with it.

2. **Adjust Scroll Speed**: Use the scroll speed slider. Find a speed you like.

3. **Control Scrolling**:
    - Click the "Scroll" button to start scrolling from the beginning. I mean that's what it's supposed to do but it doesn't lol.
    - Click "Pause" to pause. Click "Resume" to keep going.

4. **Adjust Font Size**:
    - "Increase Font Size" to make it bigger.
    - "Decrease Font Size" to make it smaller.

5. **Toggle Color Theme**: Click "Toggle Theme" to switch themes. Pick one you like. I like the maroon one.

6. **Mouse Wheel Scrolling**: Use the mouse wheel to scroll up and down.

## Screenshots

I don't have time for screenshots. Just run the app and see for yourself.
